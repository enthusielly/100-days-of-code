# 100 Days Of Code - Robertson - Log

### Day 2: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued portfolio project. 
-Made a sticky sidebar navigation (although I'm not sure it won't crash into the bottom content as it ends just below it). 
-fumbled my way through flexbox but have acheived what I wanted with my portfolio thumbnails for now (6 thumbs, 2 rows with 3 images each on desktop). I'm not completely happy with it as it doesn't resize when I shrink the window but does wrap to next row. Will need to rework for mobile and tablet.
-my code is cleaner as I've been deleting anything that doesn't seem to have any effect and tidying up in general. Also have changed design from original so much is not relevant.

**Need to do:**
- fix footer section with contact and about me with some brief blurb
- create a way to view more than the thumbs (probably open a new page with a 2-3 more images to keep things simple, or if I can make the sticky sidebar work I can put them all on the same page. Or keep it simple and only show cover plus a brief blurb. 
- learn how to use Github. I have tutorials bookmarked on Lynda but have been tired and busy with work and updating my existing portfolio
- read through a flexbox tutorial more thoroughly.

**Thoughts:** I remember more than I thought I did, but I've still forgotten a lot. Things went a lot smoother today though, and despite extreme exhaustion (3 hours sleep) I managed to do it.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Mucked around on a portfolio page I was building while going through the Free Code Camp Basic Front End projects. I had trouble centering items and played around with flexbox which I had successfully used before when I first learned it last year but with all this old code and a huge disruption in my flow I didn't know what my original intention was for that site and nothing was working. I have decided to change the layout a bit (even though getting the original layout I had to look nice would've been ENOUGH of a challenge given how rusty I am!) 

**Thoughts:** I am sooooooooo rusty! I think I last worked on this in May of 2016. Yikes! I will try not to be too ambitious with this. What I want doesn't match what I am able to do at this time and I need to come to terms with that! Also, I do not know my way around Github at all. Haha. Will have to do quite a bit of review and learn some basics over the next week outside of the challenge.
