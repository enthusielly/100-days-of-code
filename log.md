# 100 Days Of Code - Robertson - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Mucked around on a portfolio page I was building while going through the Free Code Camp Basic Front End projects. I had trouble centering items and played around with flexbox which I had successfully used before when I first learned it last year but with all this old code and a huge disruption in my flow I didn't know what my original intention was for that site and nothing was working. I have decided to change the layout a bit (even though getting the original layout I had to look nice would've been ENOUGH of a challenge given how rusty I am!) 

**Thoughts:** I am sooooooooo rusty! I think I last worked on this in May of 2016. Yikes! I will try not to be too ambitious with this. What I want doesn't match what I am able to do at this time and I need to come to terms with that! Also, I do not know my way around Github at all. Haha. Will have to do quite a bit of review and learn some basics over the next week outside of the challenge.
