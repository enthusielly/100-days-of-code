# 100 Days Of Code - Robertson - Log
****************************
### Day 8: January 19, 2017 
Had to skip another day. Deadlines loomed over me.

**Today's Progress**: Completely abaondoned hamburger but still can't get menu centered. Can't figure out how I built it. Adjusted colours, changed fonts. Attempted but was not successful connecting to FontSquirrel fonts. 

**Need to do:**
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images extended across to edges of mobile site, or at least consistently. (Currently different widths) 
- center menu bar on mobile and tablet breakpoints, then call it done for now, except for husband's content edits.
- build events and videos page like the Bandcamp section
- sort out palette and fonts

**Thoughts:** Nearly 3 hours. I was focused!

### Day 8: January 17, 2017 
Skipped a day.

**Today's Progress**: Didn't touch hamburger. A friend made some suggestions and wrote a bit of code for me for the burger but it's still not working. I did manage to tidy up a few other things and at this time I think I'd like to just center the menu (without hamburger) for now. If only I could get it to center!

**Need to do:**
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images extended across to edges of mobile site, or at least consistently. (Currently different widths) 
- center menu bar on mobile and tablet breakpoints, then call it done for now, except for husband's content edits.

**Thoughts:** Took a while to get into it but that's ok. My hours of code often end up 2 hours. Aaron suggests I can get this done in 50 days instead. =P

### Day 7: January 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't touch hamburger. Just worked on other parts of site to get it looking consistent all across (not yet successfully) and responsive. Seem to have a problem with facebook events but it could be that I am viewing on desktop and the event images don't need to switch to mobile-friendly. 

**Need to do:**
- figure out the javascript to make the hamburger menu turn 90° and for the menu to collapse and expand when on mobile or tablet.
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images extended across to edges of mobile site 
- headers consistently placed on responsive versions 


**Thoughts:** Neutral. don't feel terrible, but seeing and feeling the value of daily practice. Dying for a break though--I'm worried about other things falling by the wayside.

### Day 6: January 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Still can't get the hamburger menu to work. I must be missing some small javascript detail I don't yet understand. I've managed the hide the menu but the hamburger menu button is just not active. Giving up, I decided to tackle making the rest of the site responsive: images and text. Hard to really adjust it but this went relatively smoothly. Also tidied up some code that was not doing anything (fore example, I was very enthusiastic about using flexbox but it wasn't necessarily working properly, or needed for what I was doing.)

**Need to do:**
- check that videos and events look ok'
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- figure out the javascript to make the hamburger menu turn 90° and for the menu to collapse and expand when on mobile or tablet. 


**Thoughts:** Frustrated by the Javascript but not by that much since i haven't learned it yet. Happy to have resolved other things though.

### Day 5: January 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
I got most of the basic requirements needed for my husband's site. The header and footer are separate files as he'd requested. I installed XAMMP yesterday and was able to test the PHP files there. Phew. I also got the hover working on the links. Today I tackled making it responsive. I got as far as adding a simple hamburger menu thanks to this https://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/KbFcg but can't get the menu to actually hide and display. At the moment it covers up the logo and won't collapse. I suspect it is the javascript which I haven't learned yet and I know is coming up next in the FCC path once I finish my own portfolio! (It's nearly there.)

**Need to do:**
- figure out the javascript to make the hamburger menu turn 90° and for the menu to collapse and expand when on mobile or tablet. 
- adjust the album art to it shows one at a time instead of shrinking down at 3 across.
- check that videos and events look ok'
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site

**Thoughts:** 
I managed to fix the logo which was not centering and warping whenever I made the window too narrow. I feel like i am nearly there, except for the not knowing any javascript to feel my way around. I'm very grateful for the code Cory Simmons posted on CodePen. I just need to make it work for me.

### Day 4: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked a bit on my husband's site, mostly setting up XAMPP so I could test my PHP files. I was nervous but I was able to figure it out. Mostly the application had changed (for example to find the app it wasn't called XAMPP but Manager-OSX. How would I have known that?). fixed up the header and footer and deleted it from the other pages and it's working great. After that I tackled the photo and bio on the about page which was stupidly simple but I still struggled with it wanting to do it with Flexbox. In the end, simple CSS did the trick. sheesh.

**Need to do:**
- would like to align bottom of logo with nav links 
- can’t seem to get red hover on links to work


**Thoughts:** Not feeling so terrible today, but feeling like I don't want to really stretch my brain to figure out simple things. Maybe because it is 12:40 AM and I just want to go to bed. =)

yesterday's work is here: aaronrobertson.net although I've just realized that will chnage every time it is updated. So, I need to learn this github thing!

### Day 3: January 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
My husband urgently needed his website fixed up as he had a lead to some composing work. I'd created the old site over a year ago and struggled a bit to make it responsive, mostly by trial and error and looking it over I seem to have wiped it all out to start anew. We're keeping the basic look but replacing a few things here and there.

I was able to embed some facebook events into his events page which for some reason he was not able to do and adjust the width of some soundcloud and bandcamp sections so they looked a bit nicer, but overall I felt pretty inept. 

**Need to do:**
- figure out what the hell is wrong with the header on the about page--it is shifting over a few pixels
[x]- create a separate template-like file for the header and footer so it is reusable and needn't be pasted in to each page. This seems to be the answer: http://www.apaddedcell.com/how-automatically-include-your-header-navigation-and-footer-every-page
[x]- set the bio text properly. Currently it is flooded to the edges of the page and I know it has to be a simple solution but i am just not getting it today. Plus any class or id I put here is just not having any effect.

NOTE: I was so annoyed I went back to it twice after I wrote in my log. I realized I had mixed up the folders and was pulling files off Dropbox and editing some local files too which is why some changes were not taking effect. I managed to fix the bio text but not the photo. The 2nd time I went back I decided to look at creating separate files for the header and footer and am now in PHP territory. I downloaded XAMPP to try to test the files since I can't just preview them in a browser now but it's too late in the evening to figure it out (http://localhost/dashboard/) so I'm calling it quits tonight.

**Thoughts:** I am feeling like I hate this work! I don't expect to be an expert in it but I am really not enjoying it today. I am also feeling so utterly clumsy. During a more positive moment and thought about it as something like watercolour painting. Utterly clumsy, awful and messy at first but with practise, can yield elegant results.

The site will be up shortly, without my awful tweaks.

### Day 2: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued portfolio project. 
-Made a sticky sidebar navigation (although I'm not sure it won't crash into the bottom content as it ends just below it). 
-fumbled my way through flexbox but have acheived what I wanted with my portfolio thumbnails for now (6 thumbs, 2 rows with 3 images each on desktop). I'm not completely happy with it as it doesn't resize when I shrink the window but does wrap to next row. Will need to rework for mobile and tablet.
-my code is cleaner as I've been deleting anything that doesn't seem to have any effect and tidying up in general. Also have changed design from original so much is not relevant.

**Need to do:**
- fix footer section with contact and about me with some brief blurb
- create a way to view more than the thumbs (probably open a new page with a 2-3 more images to keep things simple, or if I can make the sticky sidebar work I can put them all on the same page. Or keep it simple and only show cover plus a brief blurb. 
- learn how to use Github. I have tutorials bookmarked on Lynda but have been tired and busy with work and updating my existing portfolio
- read through a flexbox tutorial more thoroughly.

**Thoughts:** I remember more than I thought I did, but I've still forgotten a lot. Things went a lot smoother today though, and despite extreme exhaustion (3 hours sleep) I managed to do it.

### Day 1: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Mucked around on a portfolio page I was building while going through the Free Code Camp Basic Front End projects. I had trouble centering items and played around with flexbox which I had successfully used before when I first learned it last year but with all this old code and a huge disruption in my flow I didn't know what my original intention was for that site and nothing was working. I have decided to change the layout a bit (even though getting the original layout I had to look nice would've been ENOUGH of a challenge given how rusty I am!) 

**Thoughts:** I am sooooooooo rusty! I think I last worked on this in May of 2016. Yikes! I will try not to be too ambitious with this. What I want doesn't match what I am able to do at this time and I need to come to terms with that! Also, I do not know my way around Github at all. Haha. Will have to do quite a bit of review and learn some basics over the next week outside of the challenge.
