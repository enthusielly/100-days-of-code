# 100 Days Of Code - Robertson - Log
****************************

Day 33: Feb 19, 2017

Today's Progress: nearly have my overlay text working after googling it. Almost. Not quite. Has messed up header and footer but I think I just need to adjust the z-index on both so they are on top and everything slides underneath. From a UX standpoint, the text in overlay (although currently FPO) should be underneath--the overlay could perhaps just be info about that particular image while text underneath be about the type of work I do. So it's service, image sample + optional hover detail info specific to sample, more info about service underneath.

NOTE: Ease out if it's a thing is very abrupt compared to ease in. also text is doing a weird thing on the way out of hover. there must be a better way to do this.

Thoughts: coming along!

****************************

Day 32: Feb 18, 2017

Today's Progress: Attended HTML500 and built a very simple one page profile site.

Thoughts: I realized after seeing the sample file that I was beyond this and felt bad taking up the spot when others with zero experience could be doing it. I think next time I'd like to volunteer for it instead.

Link to work: Tweeted all day long in hopes of winning a free class. Or a neon sign. My best tweet was probably this one: https://twitter.com/enthusielly/status/832986838621179907

****************************

Day 31: Feb 16, 2017

Today's Progress: sticky footer, going for mobile first, except that it's actually 2nd. Oops.  

Need to do: Center footer content; figure out overlay text. I won't be putting in too much detail into my portfolio page--yet. style some text colours responsive design

Thoughts: I'm still clumsy but so much better at this now.

Back to it! Refocus.

**Thoughts:** 
also. tired.

****************************
### Day 23: Feb 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
decided to build my Portfolio from the ground up again. Borrowed code from all sorts of places. Should I flexbox it or Bootstrap it? I keep wanting to just Flexbox it as it seems I can't mix, but maybe I just need a bit more research

**Need to do:**
Everything!

**Thoughts:**

****************************
### Day 22: Feb 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
resumed work on my FCC portfolio site. Couldn't decide between the format in the example or my own. I decided I might play around with both but wanted the basic site to function properly but I broke it somehow. Also wanted it to be able to show more details of my work somehow but none of that is working either. 

**Need to do:**
Everything. I broke it. Starting all over. again. it's annoying but good for me.

**Thoughts:** Above!

****************************
### Day 21: Feb 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
fixed misaligned strays in flexbox.

**Need to do:**
check responsiveness. maybe bootstrap is not the way to go with this since there are so many in progress things on Aaron's side. I will bootstrap my own portfolio instead.
- fix headers and alignments on mobile (also albums. soundcloud looks good)
- looks weird at 768px (just needs to rewrap at this breakpoint)
- responsive not working on mobile safari or chrome. (just mini site

**Thoughts:** i stuck with it and figured it out in 1.5 hours.

****************************
### Day 20: January 31, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
playing with bootstrap. The header looks good--on desktop. I might've broken it by mixing up the template a bit. 

**Need to do:**
- get video section to be same witdh as soundcloud
- get header in bootstrap working. not adjusting propery it seems, and when called into PHP pages the styles are lost.
- albums are wonky. i don't know what's going on.

**Thoughts:** back to square one.

****************************
### Day 19: January 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
somewhere along the way i broke the site. IT works on firefox but not on chrome and definitely not on Safari either which I guess I should stop using. And now I udnerstand why it wasn't working on my mobile--I'm using Safari. So I've switched to Bootstrap and now learning that. 

**Need to do:**
- get video section to be same witdh as soundcloud
- get header in bootstrap working. not adjusting propery it seems, and when called into PHP pages the styles are lost.

**Thoughts:** back to square one. would like to do my portoflio site someday!

****************************
### Day 18: January 28, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
noticed my site is not actually responsive. trying to figure it out but even my responsive code doens't seem to be affecting anything. Tired. Will work on it tomorrow.

**Need to do:**
- get video section to be same witdh as soundcloud
- header bloody wide
- Would like to finish this up, then try it all over again in Bootstrap. Am I torturing myself?

**Thoughts:** not much progress. just plain confused. Really want to get this sorted out before I jump into making it in Bootstrap. Stubborn. =)

**Today's Progress**: 
adjusted header and some more alignments, more work on reponsiveness.

**Need to do:**
- get video section to be same witdh as soundcloud
- header bloody wide
- Would like to finish this up, then try it all over again in Bootstrap. Am I torturing myself?

**Thoughts:** had to go to bed but wanted to get site up. looked at it and was annoyed by the header so I tweaked it. Next thing you know I've done my hour of code. I might've broken something but I have to go to bed now.

**Need to do:**
- get video section to be same witdh as soundcloud
- header bloody wide

****************************
### Day 15: January 25, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
a little disjointed today. i decided to take some time to learn Flexbox.

**Need to do:**
- proof-read bio, suggest moving quotes to other parts of site
- media images adjust so last item is align left
- problem is in between breakpoints and weird spacing before and after headers etc. USE FIREFOX TO FIGURE THIS OUT!
- Music header vs the rest are still not in the same place.
- Would like to finish this up, then try it all over again in Bootstrap. Am I torturing myself?

**Thoughts:** Still so tired i can barely keep my eyes open

****************************
### Day 14: January 25, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
Adjusted the header and subtitle so the subtitle sits under the title--both left aligned. Moved site to a shared folder so Aaron can work on it too, and we have strong version control.

**Need to do:**
- proof-read bio, suggest moving quotes to other parts of site
- media images adjust so last item is align left
- problem is in between breakpoints and weird spacing before and after headers etc. USE FIREFOX TO FIGURE THIS OUT!

****************************
### Day 13: January 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
Fiddled a bit with the events page and ways to display Facebook events. Explored options but not sure I liked any of them (I don't like the look of Facebook events outside of Facebook.) Tried the text list view and just one Facebook post that I was suggesting instead. Not sure I like it better but it probably just needs some better typography.

**Need to do:**
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images adjust so last item is align left
- sort out palette and fonts
- problem is in between breakpoints and weird spacing before and after headers etc.
- not liking the subhead anymore. Need to differentiate header section from body (Songwriting & Composition looks like a header)
- Music header vs the rest are still not in the same place.
- Would like to finish this up, then try it all over again in Bootstrap. Am I torturing myself?

**Thoughts:** I'm running out of things to tweet as I work on the same thing every day.

****************************
### Day 11-12: January 21,23, 2017 
gravenhurst weekend getaway and back from holiday

**Today's Progress**: 
changed video and fb posts from vertical list to inline but need to fix so the last item isn't centered.

**Need to do:**
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images adjust so last item is align left
- sort out palette and fonts
- problem is in between breakpoints and weird spacing before and after headers etc.
- not liking the subhead anymore. Need to differentiate header section from body (Songwriting & Composition looks like a header)
- Music header vs the rest are still ot in the same place.

**Thoughts:** much less frustrated. once I get this tidy I'd like to try to do it in bootstrap.

****************************
### Day 10: January 20, 2017 
gravenhurst weekend getaway!

**Today's Progress**: Finaly fixed some little quirk in the menu.  

**Need to do:**
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images extended across to edges of mobile site, or at least consistently. (Currently different widths) 
- build events and videos page like the Bandcamp section
- sort out palette and fonts
- problem is in between breakpoints and weird spacing before and after headers etc.

**Thoughts:** 1 hour. done.

****************************
### Day 9: January 19, 2017 
Had to skip another day. Deadlines loomed over me.

**Today's Progress**: Completely abaondoned hamburger but still can't get menu centered. Can't figure out how I built it. Adjusted colours, changed fonts. Attempted but was not successful connecting to FontSquirrel fonts. 

**Need to do:**
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images extended across to edges of mobile site, or at least consistently. (Currently different widths) 
- center menu bar on mobile and tablet breakpoints, then call it done for now, except for husband's content edits.
- build events and videos page like the Bandcamp section
- sort out palette and fonts

**Thoughts:** Nearly 3 hours. I was focused!

****************************
### Day 8: January 17, 2017 
Skipped a day.

**Today's Progress**: Didn't touch hamburger. A friend made some suggestions and wrote a bit of code for me for the burger but it's still not working. I did manage to tidy up a few other things and at this time I think I'd like to just center the menu (without hamburger) for now. If only I could get it to center!

**Need to do:**
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images extended across to edges of mobile site, or at least consistently. (Currently different widths) 
- center menu bar on mobile and tablet breakpoints, then call it done for now, except for husband's content edits.

**Thoughts:** Took a while to get into it but that's ok. My hours of code often end up 2 hours. Aaron suggests I can get this done in 50 days instead. =P

****************************
### Day 7: January 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Didn't touch hamburger. Just worked on other parts of site to get it looking consistent all across (not yet successfully) and responsive. Seem to have a problem with facebook events but it could be that I am viewing on desktop and the event images don't need to switch to mobile-friendly. 

**Need to do:**
- figure out the javascript to make the hamburger menu turn 90° and for the menu to collapse and expand when on mobile or tablet.
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- media images extended across to edges of mobile site 
- headers consistently placed on responsive versions 


**Thoughts:** Neutral. don't feel terrible, but seeing and feeling the value of daily practice. Dying for a break though--I'm worried about other things falling by the wayside.

****************************
### Day 6: January 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Still can't get the hamburger menu to work. I must be missing some small javascript detail I don't yet understand. I've managed the hide the menu but the hamburger menu button is just not active. Giving up, I decided to tackle making the rest of the site responsive: images and text. Hard to really adjust it but this went relatively smoothly. Also tidied up some code that was not doing anything (fore example, I was very enthusiastic about using flexbox but it wasn't necessarily working properly, or needed for what I was doing.)

**Need to do:**
- check that videos and events look ok'
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site
- figure out the javascript to make the hamburger menu turn 90° and for the menu to collapse and expand when on mobile or tablet. 


**Thoughts:** Frustrated by the Javascript but not by that much since i haven't learned it yet. Happy to have resolved other things though.

****************************
### Day 5: January 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
I got most of the basic requirements needed for my husband's site. The header and footer are separate files as he'd requested. I installed XAMMP yesterday and was able to test the PHP files there. Phew. I also got the hover working on the links. Today I tackled making it responsive. I got as far as adding a simple hamburger menu thanks to this https://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/KbFcg but can't get the menu to actually hide and display. At the moment it covers up the logo and won't collapse. I suspect it is the javascript which I haven't learned yet and I know is coming up next in the FCC path once I finish my own portfolio! (It's nearly there.)

**Need to do:**
- figure out the javascript to make the hamburger menu turn 90° and for the menu to collapse and expand when on mobile or tablet. 
- adjust the album art to it shows one at a time instead of shrinking down at 3 across.
- check that videos and events look ok'
- husband needs to update his bio and he can post the basic site

**Thoughts:** 
I managed to fix the logo which was not centering and warping whenever I made the window too narrow. I feel like i am nearly there, except for the not knowing any javascript to feel my way around. I'm very grateful for the code Cory Simmons posted on CodePen. I just need to make it work for me.

****************************
### Day 4: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked a bit on my husband's site, mostly setting up XAMPP so I could test my PHP files. I was nervous but I was able to figure it out. Mostly the application had changed (for example to find the app it wasn't called XAMPP but Manager-OSX. How would I have known that?). fixed up the header and footer and deleted it from the other pages and it's working great. After that I tackled the photo and bio on the about page which was stupidly simple but I still struggled with it wanting to do it with Flexbox. In the end, simple CSS did the trick. sheesh.

**Need to do:**
- would like to align bottom of logo with nav links 
- can’t seem to get red hover on links to work


**Thoughts:** Not feeling so terrible today, but feeling like I don't want to really stretch my brain to figure out simple things. Maybe because it is 12:40 AM and I just want to go to bed. =)  

**Link to work:** Tweet https://twitter.com/enthusielly/status/819782011271266305
yesterday's work is here: aaronrobertson.net although I've just realized that will chnage every time it is updated. So, I need to learn this github thing!



****************************
### Day 3: January 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
My husband urgently needed his website fixed up as he had a lead to some composing work. I'd created the old site over a year ago and struggled a bit to make it responsive, mostly by trial and error and looking it over I seem to have wiped it all out to start anew. We're keeping the basic look but replacing a few things here and there.

I was able to embed some facebook events into his events page which for some reason he was not able to do and adjust the width of some soundcloud and bandcamp sections so they looked a bit nicer, but overall I felt pretty inept. 

**Need to do:**
- figure out what the hell is wrong with the header on the about page--it is shifting over a few pixels
[x]- create a separate template-like file for the header and footer so it is reusable and needn't be pasted in to each page. This seems to be the answer: http://www.apaddedcell.com/how-automatically-include-your-header-navigation-and-footer-every-page
[x]- set the bio text properly. Currently it is flooded to the edges of the page and I know it has to be a simple solution but i am just not getting it today. Plus any class or id I put here is just not having any effect.

NOTE: I was so annoyed I went back to it twice after I wrote in my log. I realized I had mixed up the folders and was pulling files off Dropbox and editing some local files too which is why some changes were not taking effect. I managed to fix the bio text but not the photo. The 2nd time I went back I decided to look at creating separate files for the header and footer and am now in PHP territory. I downloaded XAMPP to try to test the files since I can't just preview them in a browser now but it's too late in the evening to figure it out (http://localhost/dashboard/) so I'm calling it quits tonight.

**Thoughts:** I am feeling like I hate this work! I don't expect to be an expert in it but I am really not enjoying it today. I am also feeling so utterly clumsy. During a more positive moment and thought about it as something like watercolour painting. Utterly clumsy, awful and messy at first but with practise, can yield elegant results.  

**Link to work:** Tweet https://twitter.com/enthusielly/status/819398745427210241
The site will be up shortly, without my awful tweaks.


****************************
### Day 2: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued portfolio project. 
-Made a sticky sidebar navigation (although I'm not sure it won't crash into the bottom content as it ends just below it). 
-fumbled my way through flexbox but have acheived what I wanted with my portfolio thumbnails for now (6 thumbs, 2 rows with 3 images each on desktop). I'm not completely happy with it as it doesn't resize when I shrink the window but does wrap to next row. Will need to rework for mobile and tablet.
-my code is cleaner as I've been deleting anything that doesn't seem to have any effect and tidying up in general. Also have changed design from original so much is not relevant.

**Need to do:**
- fix footer section with contact and about me with some brief blurb
- create a way to view more than the thumbs (probably open a new page with a 2-3 more images to keep things simple, or if I can make the sticky sidebar work I can put them all on the same page. Or keep it simple and only show cover plus a brief blurb. 
- learn how to use Github. I have tutorials bookmarked on Lynda but have been tired and busy with work and updating my existing portfolio
- read through a flexbox tutorial more thoroughly.

**Thoughts:** I remember more than I thought I did, but I've still forgotten a lot. Things went a lot smoother today though, and despite extreme exhaustion (3 hours sleep) I managed to do it.

****************************
### Day 1: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Mucked around on a portfolio page I was building while going through the Free Code Camp Basic Front End projects. I had trouble centering items and played around with flexbox which I had successfully used before when I first learned it last year but with all this old code and a huge disruption in my flow I didn't know what my original intention was for that site and nothing was working. I have decided to change the layout a bit (even though getting the original layout I had to look nice would've been ENOUGH of a challenge given how rusty I am!) 

**Thoughts:** I am sooooooooo rusty! I think I last worked on this in May of 2016. Yikes! I will try not to be too ambitious with this. What I want doesn't match what I am able to do at this time and I need to come to terms with that! Also, I do not know my way around Github at all. Haha. Will have to do quite a bit of review and learn some basics over the next week outside of the challenge.
